# Team-Profil-Generator

This application enabled a user to create a Team Profile page through the console - answering a series of questions using a NPM package called Inquire. The information asked for varied depending on the user's input into the questionaire - If an intern was the employee it would ask questions pertaining to interns etc.  

The Information entered was then rendered on an HTML document, which was then placed in a folder. This rendering was done using the .fs npm package.
